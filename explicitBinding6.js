/*
  This code defines an object `obj` with:
    - a property `x` set to 42
    - a method `fn` defined as a regular function logging `this.x`

  When calling `obj.fn.call(null)`:
    - `.call()` explicitly sets the `this` context to `null`.
    - In non-strict mode, `null` (and `undefined`) passed as `this` to `.call()` defaults to the global object (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js).
    - In strict mode (which is default for many environments and especially in classes/modules), `this` will remain `null`.
  
  Therefore:
    - In non-strict mode, `this` inside `fn` is the global object.
      Since global object likely doesn't have `x`, `this.x` is `undefined`.
    - In strict mode, `this` is `null`, and accessing `this.x` causes a `TypeError`.

  The console output or error depends on the environment and strictness.

  Binding type:
    - This is an example of "explicit binding" using `.call()`, where you specify the `this` value.
    - But JavaScript coerces `null` to global object in non-strict mode.

let obj = {
  x: 42,

  fn: function() {
    console.log(this.x);
  }
}

obj.fn.call(null); // Output: undefined in non-strict mode or error in strict mode
